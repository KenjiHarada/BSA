History:
        (July 5th 2013) First release

        (November 25th 2013) Fixed the bugs in all application codes.
        These bugs count the last data point in a data file or STDIN doubly.

        (December 15th 2013) A null line and an unformatted line are skipped.

        (October 15th 2014) Added the "CC2" folder. The "CC2" folder
        includes the code of new command "new_bfss" which deals with
        a finite-size scaling with or without corrections to scaling.
