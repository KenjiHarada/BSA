## History

(April 21th 2015) Fixed a bug in the output of scaling functions. Added the option to control the x-range of outputted scaling functions.

(November 9th 2014) Fixed a bug in the output of format 1.

(November 6th 2014) Fixed a bug for the use of the option -t.

(October 15th 2014) Added the "CC2" folder. The "CC2" folder includes
the code of new command "new_bfss" which deals with a finite-size
scaling with or without corrections to scaling.

(December 15th 2013) A null line and an unformatted line are skipped.

(November 25th 2013) Fixed the bugs in all application codes.
These bugs count the last data point in a data file or STDIN doubly.

(July 5th 2013) First release
